# 📂 MariaDB Database Restore Guide

When working with databases, it's important to have backups in case of system failures, accidental deletions, or migrations to a new server. This guide will walk you through restoring a MariaDB database using a backup file (db.sql). It is designed for users with minimal technical knowledge, ensuring a smooth and error-free restoration process.

## ➤ Prerequisites
Before you can restore the database, there are a few important steps to prepare your system.

### 📍 Check if MariaDB is Installed
MariaDB is the database management system required for this process. To check if it’s already installed, run the following command in your terminal:
```sh
    mariadb --version
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> If MariaDB is installed, you’ll see an output showing the version number. If it is not installed, follow the next step.



### 📍 Install MariaDB (If Not Installed)
If the previous command indicates that MariaDB is missing, install it using the appropriate command for your operating system.

- **For Debian/Ubuntu Users**:
Run this command:
    ```sh
        sudo apt update && sudo apt install mariadb-server -y
    ```

- **For RHEL/CentOS Users**:
Run this command:
    ```sh
        sudo yum install mariadb-server -y
    ```
- This will install MariaDB and all its necessary components.

> [!WARNING]
>
> Installation requires administrative (root) privileges.



### 📍 Start and Enable MariaDB
After installation, ensure that MariaDB is running. Use the following commands:

```sh
    sudo systemctl start mariadb
    sudo systemctl enable mariadb
```

- The first command starts the MariaDB service.
- The second command ensures MariaDB starts automatically every time the system boots.

>[!TIP]
> 
> If MariaDB is already running, you can check its status using:
> ```sh
>  sudo systemctl status mariadb
> ```
> This command will show the status of the MariaDB service.



## ➤ Steps to Restore the Database
Now that your system is ready, follow these steps to restore the database from the backup file.

### 📍 Step 1: Create a New Database
A database must exist before you can import data into it. Run the following command to create a new database:
```sh
    mysql -u root -p -e "CREATE DATABASE <database_name>;"
```

> [!NOTE]
> 
> If the `db.sql` file already contains a `CREATE DATABASE` statement, this step may not be necessary.


- **Explanation**:
    - `mysql -u root -p` → Logs into the MariaDB server as the root user. You will be asked for the root password.

    - `-e "CREATE DATABASE <database_name>;"` → Executes a command inside MariaDB to create a new database.

    - Replace `<database_name>` with your preferred database name.

- **Example**:
    - If you want to create a database named my_database, use:
    ```sh
        mysql -u root -p -e "CREATE DATABASE my_database;"
    ```

> [!TIP]
>
> Use a meaningful database name to avoid confusion.

### 📍 Step 2:Restore the Database from the Backup File
Once you have created the database, restore the backup by running:
```sh
    mysql -u root -p <database_name> < db.sql
```

> [!WARNING]
>
> This command will replace any existing data in the selected database. Make sure you've chosen the correct database to avoid losing important data.

- **Explanation**:
    - `mysql -u root -p` → Logs into MariaDB as the root user.

    - `<database_name>` → The name of the database where you want to import the backup.

    - `< db.sql` → This tells MariaDB to read the db.sql file and execute the commands inside it.

- **Example**:
    - If your database name is `my_database`, use:
    ```sh
        mysql -u root -p my_database < db.sql
    ```

> [!TIP]
>
> If the backup file is in another directory, provide the full path:
> ```sh
>   mysql -u root -p <database_name> < /path/to/db.sql
> ```
- After running this command, MariaDB will import all tables and data from the db.sql file.




## ➤ Troubleshooting
Here are some common errors and solutions while restoring a MariaDB database.
### 📍 Access Denied Error
**Error Message**: 
```sh
    ERROR 1045 (28000): Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost' (using    password: YES)
```
- **Possible Solutions**:

    - Verify that the password is correct.
    - Ensure the MariaDB root user has proper privileges.
    - If you’ve forgotten the password, reset it by following MariaDB’s password recovery process.
> [!TIP]
>
>  Use the following command to check user privileges:
> ```sh
>  mysql -u root -p -e "SHOW GRANTS FOR 'root'@'localhost';"
> ```


### 📍 MariaDB Command Not Found
If running `mysql --version` gives an error:
```bash
    command not found: mysql
```
- **Possible Solutions**:
    - MariaDB may not be installed. Reinstall it using the steps above.
    - Check if MariaDB is in your system’s `PATH` by running:
    ```sh
        which mysql
    ```
    - If the command returns no output, try using the full path:
    ```sh
        /usr/bin/mysql -u root -p
    ```

> [!NOTE]
> 
> The default installation path varies based on the operating system.


### 📍 Errors in SQL File
If you receive syntax errors while restoring the database, check `db.sql` for:
    - Corrupt or incomplete SQL commands.
    - Conflicting `CREATE DATABASE` or `USE` statements.
    - Unsupported SQL statements due to MariaDB version differences.
> [!TIP]
>
> Open the `db.sql` file in a text editor and manually inspect its contents before running the restore command.

## ➤ Important Notes

- **Permissions**: Ensure you have the necessary permissions to restore the database. If using a non-root user, make sure they have the required privileges.

- **Duplicate Database Issues**: If your backup file (`db.sql`) contains `CREATE DATABASE` statements, you might need to edit it before restoring. Otherwise, it could cause errors if the database already exists.

- **File Location**: Ensure the `db.sql` file is located in the directory from which you are running the command. If it is in another location, you need to specify the full path to the file.

- **Backup and Restore**: Always make a backup of your database before attempting to restore a backup.
